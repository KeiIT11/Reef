# What is Reef
reef is an app that allows you to inscribe your efforts into a blockchain. The contents of your efforts will be recorded semi-permanently, so your efforts will be preserved for posterity.

# What can Reef do?
For example, When you become a grandfather, you may be able to brag to your grandchildren about your efforts.
Also, think about it, wouldn't it be interesting to know how geniuses such as Einstein spent their time in life?

Reef makes this kind of future feasible.

#Problems that Reef can solve.
Next, let me explain the problem that reef can solve.

Reef can help people who are having trouble getting things done by using the Pomodoro Technique.
The Pomodoro Technique is a technique that allows for increased and longer-lasting concentration by taking appropriate breaks.

However, there is a problem with the Pomodoro Technique. The problem is that we get too absorbed in our work and forget to take breaks.

In reef, the system creates an incentive to take a break, because if you don't take a break, your efforts will not be inscribed in the blockchain.This is why reef can help people who are not making progress on their work.

# Features of the app
Next, let me introduce the features.

The first function is the timer function. 
By working with the Pomodoro Technique, you can work more efficiently.

The second function is the record function.
You can save your work to the blockchain. 
From the app, you connect to Metamask and execute a smart contract. Your work will then be stored on the blockchain. In this case, we are using the Goerli network as the storage destination.

The third function is the search function.
You can check the contents of other people's efforts stored in the blockchain.

# The future of this app
I would like to explain the future of this app.

Reef is scalable because it uses a simple smart contract,
so it could be partnered with many different apps.

In my opinion, this app would work well with sns. In the future, I would like to try to add social networking features to this application.

# In Conclusion.

Reef can help people who are having trouble getting things done and create a better future.

Thank you for watching!
